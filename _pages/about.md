I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Michigan and a member of the CROMA Lab focusing on HCI and AI research.

I'm currently working on AV3D, a project that utilizes crowdsourcing to annotate 2D videos with dimension lines to estimate 3D objects through aggregate particle filtering. This new method can be used to train autonomous vehicles with 3D state data without the need for high-cost 3D cameras and expand the training data space of edge cases not yet captured by 3D cameras.
